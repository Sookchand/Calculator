#  Calculator {Python Game}
The calculator program is written in Python is a simple command-line calculator. Here's a brief description of its functionality:

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**: The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations. It has functions for addition (`add`), subtraction (`subtract`), multiplication (`multiply`), and division (`divide`). Each of these functions takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the operation.

- **User Interaction**: The calculator interacts with the user through the command line. It prompts the user to enter the first number, then shows the available operations (+, -, *, /). After the user picks an operation, it prompts for the second number. It then performs the chosen operation on the two numbers and prints the result.

- **Continuous Calculation**: After performing an operation, the calculator gives the user an option to continue calculating with the result (by typing 'y') or to exit (by typing 'n'). If the user chooses to continue, it uses the result as the first number in the next operation.

- **Error Handling**: The calculator handles invalid inputs by checking if the inputs are valid numbers and if the chosen operation is valid. If an invalid input is detected, it prompts the user to enter a valid input.

This program is a great example of a simple but functional command-line application written in Python. It demonstrates basic concepts like functions, loops, and error handling.

## Tech Stack
The code is written in Python, a popular high-level programming language.  Here are the key Python features and standard library modules used:

- **Built-in Data Types**: The program uses Python's built-in data types, including numbers (for the calculations) and dictionaries (to map operation symbols to functions).

- **Functions**: The program defines several functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, and `calculator`). These functions encapsulate the logic for the various operations that the calculator can perform.

- **Control Flow**: The program uses control flow constructs like `while` loops and `if` statements to control the execution of the program based on user input.

- **Exception Handling**: The program uses a `try`/`except` block to handle potential errors that can occur when converting user input to a number.

- **Standard Input/Output**: The program uses the built-in `input` function to read user input from the command line, and the `print` function to output results to the command line.

No external libraries or frameworks were used; everything you see in the code comes with Python out of the box. This makes it a great example of what can be accomplished with just the core features of Python.
## Documentation
Here are the documentation links for the technologies and concepts used in the code:

You can find the official Python documentation on the Python website. Here are some useful links:

- [Python.org Documentation](^1^): This is the main page for Python's documentation. You can browse the docs online or download a copy of your own. The documentation, tutorials, and guides are constantly evolving.

- [Python 3.11.5 Documentation](^2^): This is the official documentation for Python 3.11.5. It includes tutorials, library references, language references, and guides on how to use Python on different platforms.

- [Python Developer's Guide](^3^): This guide is useful if you're interested in contributing to Python's development. It includes Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and information on Python.org maintenance and administration.

- [The Python Language Reference](^4^): This reference manual describes the syntax and ‚Äúcore semantics‚Äù of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing.

## Lessons Learned
Building a simple calculator program like this in Python can provide several valuable lessons:

1. **Understanding Python Syntax**: This project helps you understand the basic syntax of Python, including defining functions, using control flow constructs like loops and if-else statements, and handling exceptions.

2. **Working with User Input**: The project involves taking user input and processing it. This helps you understand how to work with the `input()` function and handle potential errors in user input.

3. **Implementing Arithmetic Operations**: Implementing the basic arithmetic operations helps you understand how to perform mathematical operations in Python.

4. **Using Dictionaries for Function Mapping**: The use of a dictionary to map operation symbols to their corresponding functions is a practical example of how powerful Python's data structures can be.

5. **Understanding Program Flow Control**: The use of a while loop to continue performing operations until the user decides to stop gives you a good understanding of how to control the flow of a program based on user input or other conditions.

6. **Error Handling**: By adding error checking to handle invalid inputs, you learn about exception handling in Python, which is crucial for building robust applications.

Remember, every coding project, no matter how small, is an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer! üòä
